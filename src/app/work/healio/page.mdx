# Healio App

**Role:** UX Designer  
**Type:** Course assignment at Noroff, spring 2025  
**Tools:** Figma, Pitch, Canva

---

## Background
For this assignment, our group designed **Healio**, a mobile app supporting people recovering from shoulder injuries. Healio helps users track their physical progress, log habits, complete physiotherapy exercises, and reduce stress with guided meditation.

Our goal was to create a **user-centered experience** that motivates recovery while also collecting valuable data for medical research. The process included persona development, information architecture, user flows, and both low- and high-fidelity prototypes.

---

## Goal
Healio needed to balance **motivation and usability**: the app should encourage patients through a long recovery journey while providing clear, glanceable feedback on their progress. At the same time, it had to remain simple and intuitive, reducing frustration for users already dealing with pain or limited mobility.

---

## The Process
We used the **Design Thinking Process**, starting with a detailed persona, “Chris Harper”, a 37-year-old designer and former competitive swimmer recovering from shoulder surgery.

His frustrations with tracking exercises and uncertainty about progress shaped our design challenges.

We created an information architecture and user flow for Healio's onboarding. This ensured clear navigation, prioritized key features, and gave users a smooth start before moving into prototypes.

Through **competitive analysis (SWOT) and ideation**, we found a gap in the market for a motivating, personalized recovery app.

As a group we brainstormed solutions, sketched concepts, and built multiple **low-fi prototypes** to explore options for login, pain tracking, and progress visualization.

## Design Principles

- **Accessibility (WCAG AA):** Color contrast checked, touch-friendly elements, and support for users with motor/visual impairments.

- **Consistency:** Unified icons, typography, and layouts across flows.

- **Clarity & Simplicity:** Calm, minimal design that reduces cognitive load.
- **Emotional Design:** Friendly illustrations and encouraging language.
- **Empowering UX:** Progress tracking, reminders, and routines that give users control.

---

## Result
The final **high-fidelity prototype** of Healio provides a **calm, motivating, and accessible recovery experience**. From onboarding through progress tracking, the app maintains a consistent visual language and user-friendly flow, ensuring users can focus on recovery instead of navigating complexity.
