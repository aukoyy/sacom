## Background
For this assignment, our group designed **Healio**, a mobile app supporting people recovering from shoulder injuries. Healio helps users track their physical progress, log habits, complete physiotherapy exercises, and reduce stress with guided meditation.

Our goal was to create a **user-centered experience** that motivates recovery while also collecting valuable data for medical research. The process included persona development, information architecture, user flows, and both low- and high-fidelity prototypes.

#### The challenge
Supporting users in completing shoulder rehabilitation exercises correctly and consistently without overwhelming them with complex or clinical solutions.

#### The goal
The goal was to design a user-centered recovery experience that supports patients throughout a long and demanding rehabilitation journey. Healio needed to motivate users while remaining simple and intuitive for individuals experiencing pain or limited mobility. By offering clear, glanceable feedback on progress, the app aimed to encourage sustained engagement over time.

## The Process
We used the **Design Thinking Process**, starting with a detailed persona, “Chris Harper”, a 37-year-old designer and former competitive swimmer recovering from shoulder surgery.

His frustrations with tracking exercises and uncertainty about progress shaped our design challenges.

We created an information architecture and user flow for Healio's onboarding. This ensured clear navigation, prioritized key features, and gave users a smooth start before moving into prototypes.

Through **competitive analysis (SWOT) and ideation**, we found a gap in the market for a motivating, personalized recovery app.

As a group we brainstormed solutions, sketched concepts, and built multiple **low-fi prototypes** to explore options for login, pain tracking, and progress visualization.

## Design Principles

- **Accessibility (WCAG AA):** Color contrast checked, touch-friendly elements, and support for users with motor/visual impairments.

- **Consistency:** Unified icons, typography, and layouts across flows.

- **Clarity & Simplicity:** Calm, minimal design that reduces cognitive load.
- **Emotional Design:** Friendly illustrations and encouraging language.
- **Empowering UX:** Progress tracking, reminders, and routines that give users control.

## Result
The final **high-fidelity prototype** of Healio provides a **calm, motivating, and accessible recovery experience**. From onboarding through progress tracking, the app maintains a consistent visual language and user-friendly flow, ensuring users can focus on recovery instead of navigating complexity.

#### Areas for improvement
With more time, I would continue refining the interactive states and flows to make them even clearer, especially around onboarding and exercise tracking. I would also expand usability testing with a wider range of users to uncover more edge cases and improve overall consistency and accessibility.

## My contribution
I led the competitive analysis during the ideation phase, reviewing existing recovery and health apps to identify strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in the market. This analysis highlighted a clear opportunity for a more personalized, motivating, and user-friendly injury recovery solution, particularly for shoulder rehabilitation. These insights directly shaped Haelio’s value proposition, emphasizing clear visual feedback, simple routines, and sustained motivation throughout the recovery journey.

In addition, I was responsible for ensuring consistency and accessibility across the app. I evaluated designs against WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines using the POUR framework (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust), making informed design adjustments to improve contrast, readability, interaction patterns, and overall usability for a diverse range of users.

## What I Learned
This project strengthened my skills in:

- **User-centered design:** designing for a real persona with specific recovery challenges.
- **Accessibility & consistency:** applying WCAG AA checks and creating predictable patterns.
- **Collaboration:** aligning with a team on flows, interactions, and visual style.

Overall, Healio was a valuable exercise in creating an **inclusive, motivating app experience** for users facing physical and emotional challenges in their daily lives.
