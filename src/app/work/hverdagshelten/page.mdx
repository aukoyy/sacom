## Background

#### The challenge
Information about free support in Norway is scattered across websites, Facebook groups, and posters. This makes it stressful and time-consuming for people to find help when they need it.

#### The goal  
A clear, accessible app that centralizes all free offerings with simple language, reminders, and two user flows: private users + organizations.

## Process

To understand how people find and navigate free local support, we combined surveys, litteratur reviews and competitor analysis. We mapped out the main pain points, defined our primary users, explored multiple concepts, and iterated the UI through prototyping and testing. Below is a snapshot of the process from first insights to final design.

After gathering all the results from the research the affinity mapping confirmed that the problem is not a lack of support or free offers, but rather that information is fragmented, inaccessible, and hard to find in time. This insight became a foundation for our problem statement and guided our design decisions moving forward.

**Quote:**

> I often find out about free events after they happened.

Based on the insights, we defined our primary user, Maria - a single mother who wants free activities and support, but often feels lost navigating fragmented channels. This led to a clear problem statement: people in financially vulnerable situations need one central, easy-to-understand place to find help they qualify for.

From this, we outlined the core needs that would guide the design: simple language, nearby offers, reminders for deadlines, a clear overview and, most importantly, a dignified and non-stigmatising experience.

During ideation, we explored a range of concepts through sketching workshops and wireframing. We converged on a structure that balanced clarity and flexibility: a bottom navigation, a hybrid map-list view, step-by-step financial guidance and two tailored user flows - one for private individuals and one for organizations.

The final information architecture was kept intentionally simple: *Home, Categories, Map, Application guidance, Profile*. Saved items and reminders became key features to help users keep track of what matters.

### Create

In the prototyping phase, we focused on creating a calm and supportive visual language. A warm palette, accessible typography (Inter), generous spacing and clear iconography were chosen to reduce cognitive load for users who might already feel stressed.

We ensured WCAG-compliant contrast and large touch targets throughout. The high-fidelity prototype brought these decisions together into a solution that feels simple, inclusive and easy to navigate - with clear feedback, reminders and guidance for both private users and organizations.

## Result

We ran two rounds of usability testing - first on low-fidelity wireframes, then on the high-fidelity prototype. Testing revealed issues around navigation labels, calendar colours, feedback after saving or publishing, and the visibility of saved items.

Based on this, we added clearer labels under icons, a calendar legend, confirmation states for key actions, an “end repeat” option for events and a more readable statistics page for organizations. These small changes had a big impact on clarity and confidence.

### My contribution

My main responsibility in this project was the entire **company-side experience**. I designed the full flow for organizations, from onboarding to publishing events and accessing statistics. This included creating wireframes and high-fidelity screens, developing the information architecture for company users, and designing a clear, intuitive structure for publishing and managing events.

### What I have learned

Throughout this project, I learned how much simple language and clear feedback improve usability, especially for users who may feel stressed or overwhelmed. Designing for two user groups taught me the importance of a solid navigation hierarchy, and early testing showed how quickly usability issues can be uncovered and resolved. Overall, the project strengthened my ability to make design decisions grounded in real user needs and to turn research insights into accessible, intuitive solutions.
